# Locality
We made Locality as part of the WHO COVID-19 Global Hackathon, under the category "Businesses" to address "The set of problems that businesses are facing to stay afloat, collaborate effectively, and move parts of their business online." It is critical for communities to help local businesses/stores stay afloat. Small stores can be easily overlooked during the current health crisis, so Locality aims to highlight local vendors and drive community support. We provide:
1. Searchable listings of local businesses/stores.
2. Information on each business' specific needs/requests.
3. Ways to share listings and reach out to offer support.

## To run the WIP (work in progress) app locally:
1. You may need to create a folder "opt/python/log" (outside of the repo)
2. Run "python2 application.py" inside the WIP folder
3. The page will be up on http://localhost:8000

## To deploy on AWS:
1. Add any new dependencies to "requirements.txt"
2. Make a ZIP containing only the files (i.e., no parent folder)
3. Upload to AWS
