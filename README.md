# To run the WIP app:
1. You make need to create the folder "opt/python/log"
2. run "python2 application.py"

# To deploy on AWS:
1. Add any new dependencies to "requirements.txt"
2. Make a ZIP containing only the files (i.e., no parent folder)
3. Upload to AWS

# TODOS:
1. Refactor the HTML into a templates folder (with a styles folder for CSS)
2. Add framework for HTML (static)
3. Build out the backend (figure out how it can modified safely)
